                                When looking at the different outputs, I noticed 
                                that the tone, word choice, and structure of the 
                                messages changed depending on who they were 
                                meant for and the level of formality.  I used 
                                Chat-GPT 4.0 and DeepSeek 1.0 with three 
                                different prompts (professional, linked in 
                                message and friendly). The formal email was 
                                polite and professional, with a clear structure. 
                                It used full sentences and respectful language 
                                to make a formal request, which is typical for 
                                business communication. For LinkedIn, the tone 
                                became a little more conversational, though 
                                still professional. It was shorter and more to 
                                the point, with phrases like “I’d love to 
                                connect” making it more friendly but still 
                                appropriate for networking.In the informal 
                                message to a friend, the tone was the most 
                                relaxed. It had a casual feel, using phrases 
                                like “Hey” and “Would you mind passing along 
                                my resume?” to make it feel more like a friendly 
                                favor. The structure was much looser compared to 
                                the other two. Overall, ChatGPT adjusted the 
                                tone, word choice, and format to fit the 
                                situation—whether it was a formal email, 
                                LinkedIn message, or casual request to a 
                                friend—while still getting the same message 
                                across. When I tried using DeepSeek - I found 
                                it incredibly helpful that it showed what it 
                                was changing and why.
