                            When looking at the different outputs, I noticed 
                            that the tone, word choice, and structure of the 
                            messages changed depending on who they were 
                            meant for and the level of formality.  I used 
                            Chat-GPT 4.0 and DeepSeek 1.0 with three 
                            different prompts (professional, linked in 
                            message and friendly).<br><br>The formal email was 
                            polite and professional, with a clear structure. 
                            It used full sentences and respectful language 
                            to make a formal request, which is typical for 
                            business communication. For LinkedIn, the tone 
                            became a little more conversational, though 
                            still professional. It was shorter and more to 
                            the point, with phrases like “I’d love to 
                            connect” making it more friendly but still 
                            appropriate for networking.In the informal 
                            message to a friend, the tone was the most 
                            relaxed. It had a casual feel, using phrases 
                            like “Hey” and “Would you mind passing along 
                            my resume?” to make it feel more like a friendly 
                            favor. The structure was much looser compared to 
                            the other two.

                            Overall, ChatGPT adjusted 
                            the tone, word choice, and format to fit the 
                            situation—whether it was a formal email, 
                            LinkedIn message, or casual request to a 
                            friend—while still getting the same message 
                            across. When I tried using DeepSeek - I found 
                            it incredibly helpful that it showed what it 
                            was changing and why.
